# Logo Setup Instructions

To add the Focus Medical Centre logo to the Overtime PDF reports:

1. Place your logo file in the `public` folder
2. Name it `logo.png` (or update the filename in `src/pages/Overtime.tsx` line ~230)
3. Recommended logo dimensions: 200x60 pixels (or similar aspect ratio)
4. Supported formats: PNG, JPG (PNG recommended for transparency)

The logo will automatically appear in the top-left corner of all generated PDF reports.

If the logo file is not found, the PDF will still generate without it.
